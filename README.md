This repository contains two beginner-friendly Python tasks focused on core programming concepts such as functions, loops/recursion, user input, and mathematical computations using the `math` module.

---
## Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function

###  Problem Statement:
Write a Python program that:
1. Defines a function named `factorial` that takes a number as an argument.
2. Calculates its factorial using a loop or recursion.
3. Returns the calculated factorial.
4. Calls the function with a sample number and prints the output.

## task 2 : Using the Math Module for Calculations

### Problem statement :
Write a Python program that:
1.   Asks the user for a number as input.
2.   Uses the math module to calculate the:
  o   Square root of the number
  o   Natural logarithm (log base e) of the number
  o   Sine of the number (in radians)
3.   Displays the calculated results.
